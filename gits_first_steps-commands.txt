The key's randomart image is:
+--[ED25519 256]--+
|                 |
|        .        |
|        .=       |

|     + =S=.      |
|  . x		  |
| o = B = =+ .    |
|. =.= B.=oo.     |
| oE+o=++o+       |
+----[SHA256]-----+

go to .ssd folder where id_ed25519.pub is and then

command cat id_ed25519.pub 

enter

now is showing a key public, just copy to imput it at github acount

at git hub create a SSH keys pasting a ssh key copied before.

something like that ssh-ed25519 AAAçlaskfçaljskfjçalsfhçlaskdjfçlaksfhhuoiwjfalçksdhf+9q9ukzROgj6hbO/+g0c+ marcuscoelho07@gmail.com

now you need eval a ssh agent with a command inside git bash at .ssh folder

eval $(ssh-agent -s)

the result is like that "Agent pid 1562"

now you need to link this folder ssh agent with a ssh key

command is $ ssh-add id_ed25519
Enter passphrase for id_ed25519:
as result has "Identity added: id_ed25519 (marcuscoelho07@gmail.com)"
